# WeatherSite
A webpage made with an API, made to present user with actual weather in any city in the whole world at any given time. 

# Guide for usage
The page does not have many functions but is based on simple information that must be represented in a well-functioning way together with an image that represents the city the user has searched for.



1. Enter any city you can think of in the search box
2. Press the small planet next to the search box (the search button) (I couldn't get the search to work by pressing enter so it may be that you can only search by pressing it)
3. The computer will display information about the weather in the selected city and a background image representing something from that particular city will appear
4. If the user searches for a small town, no image will be displayed as the image database does not contain images from smaller towns
5. If the user searches for a city that does not exist in the database or reality or enters the name of a city incorrectly, an error message will appear on the screen
